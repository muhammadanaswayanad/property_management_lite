## Key Differences from Previous Plan

| Previous (Sobha Development) | Current (Room Rental ERP) |
|------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Property development projects | Property rental management |
| Sales & lead management | Tenant & collection management |
| Project phases & timelines | Daily operations & rent tracking |
| Unit sales tracking | Room occupancy & rent collection |
| Location hierarchy for development | Property→Flat→Room hierarchy |
| Development cost tracking | Operational expense tracking |

## Next Steps

1. **Confirm Requirements**: Review this plan against your actual operations
2. **Start Fresh Implementation**: Begin with Phase 1 - Property structure
3. **Focus Areas**: Daily operations, cash flow, and tenant management
4. **Dashboard Priority**: Real-time visibility of collections and dues

Would you like me to start implementing the **Room Rental ERP** system based on these requirements instead of the development/sales system?
